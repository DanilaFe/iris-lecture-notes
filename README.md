# Iris Lecture Notes

This is the official source code for the Iris Lecture Notes (ILN), that has been
used for multiple iterations of the Program Logics course at
Aarhus University, Denmark.

The ILN are under continuous development, for which we welcome suggested
changes (for more on how to contribute see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

The ILN can be compiled using `make`.
